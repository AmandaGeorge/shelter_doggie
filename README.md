# ShelterDoggie

## Description

ShelterDoggie is an app for people who want to adopt a dog from a shelter and want the dog to be a good fit for them.  This app takes some of the guess-work out of choosing a dog.  By filling out the desired characteristics form, people can learn which breeds would be best for them.  Then ShelterDoggie will show the user where he/she can find those breeds in shelters near them.
